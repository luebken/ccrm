# Robinhood Market Volatility Monitoring

Derek's risk management team needs real-time monitoring of market volatility to protect retail investors during extreme market conditions. Recent GameStop-style events highlighted gaps in their current monitoring capabilities.

Complex technical requirements for processing high-frequency market data and triggering dynamic trading halts. Our financial markets expertise and regulatory compliance capabilities are well-suited.

Regulatory scrutiny makes vendor selection critical. Long evaluation process expected but strong business case for protecting retail investors and avoiding regulatory issues.
