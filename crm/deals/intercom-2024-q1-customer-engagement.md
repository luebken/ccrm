# Intercom Customer Engagement Analytics - CLOSED WON

William's product team successfully implemented our customer engagement analytics platform to optimize Intercom's messaging and support workflows. Contract signed after successful pilot program demonstration.

Platform integration completed smoothly with existing Intercom architecture. Strong ROI demonstrated through improved customer response times and engagement scoring accuracy.

Excellent reference customer for SaaS customer engagement use cases. Implementation begins Q2 with potential for expansion into additional Intercom product lines.
