# Coinbase Trading Pattern Analytics

Mike's team needs sophisticated monitoring of trading patterns to improve market making algorithms and detect unusual activity. Nisha's compliance team requires analytics for regulatory reporting across multiple jurisdictions.

Complex technical requirements involving real-time crypto market data processing and regulatory compliance monitoring. Our financial services expertise and crypto-specific algorithms are well-aligned.

Long sales cycle expected due to regulatory complexity and Coinbase's careful vendor evaluation process. Strong potential for expansion into other crypto products if successful.
