# Snowflake Data Governance Analytics

Daniel's platform team needs comprehensive data governance monitoring across Snowflake's enterprise customers. Michelle's compliance team requires detailed audit trails and access pattern analytics for regulatory requirements.

Complex technical requirements involving multi-tenant data governance across cloud platforms. Our enterprise data analytics platform aligns well with Snowflake's architecture and compliance needs.

Large enterprise deal with extended evaluation process. Strong competition from governance-focused vendors but our real-time analytics capabilities and Snowflake integration expertise provide advantages.
