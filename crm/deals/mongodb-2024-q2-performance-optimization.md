# MongoDB Database Performance Analytics

Rajesh's engineering team needs specialized monitoring for MongoDB performance optimization across their cloud platform. Current tooling lacks deep insights into query optimization and resource allocation patterns.

Excellent technical fit - our database analytics platform integrates natively with MongoDB Atlas. Strong validation from pilot program showing 20% performance improvements in test environments.

Budget approved and technical validation complete. Main decision factor is timing with MongoDB's Q2 platform roadmap. Highest probability qualified deal in current pipeline.
