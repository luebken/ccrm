# Snapchat AR Filter Performance Analytics - CLOSED LOST

Christopher's AR platform team evaluated our computer vision analytics for AR filter performance optimization but selected specialized AR analytics vendor. Snapchat chose solution with deeper augmented reality expertise.

Technical validation showed promise but competitor had stronger AR-specific features and existing relationships with other social media AR platforms. Our general analytics platform lacked specialized AR metrics.

Lost to AR-focused competitor with domain expertise in augmented reality performance monitoring. Valuable feedback for potential AR analytics platform development in future.
