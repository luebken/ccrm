# Okta Identity Access Analytics

Jenny's security team submitted proposal for advanced identity access pattern monitoring. Priya's engineering team validated our anomaly detection capabilities for identifying suspicious authentication patterns.

Proposal includes comprehensive identity analytics with ML-based threat detection. Security review completed with positive feedback on our compliance certifications and data protection capabilities.

Contract negotiations in progress with legal teams. Main challenge is integration complexity with Okta's existing security infrastructure, but technical validation was successful.
