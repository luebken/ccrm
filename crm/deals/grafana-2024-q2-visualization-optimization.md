# Grafana Dashboard Performance Optimization

Torsten's engineering team submitted proposal for advanced dashboard performance monitoring. They need analytics to optimize query performance and rendering efficiency across complex visualization workflows.

Proposal includes specialized monitoring for Grafana's visualization pipeline with real-time performance optimization recommendations. Technical validation showed significant improvement in dashboard loading times.

Contract negotiations progressing well with standard terms. Swedish procurement process is efficient and budget approved. Expected to close in Q2 with strong potential for expansion.
