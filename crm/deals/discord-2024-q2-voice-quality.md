# Discord Voice Chat Quality Monitoring

Robert's engineering team needs better visibility into voice chat quality across Discord's gaming communities. Current monitoring misses regional quality issues and can't predict server capacity needs during gaming events.

Strong technical fit - our real-time audio monitoring capabilities align perfectly with their needs. Gaming community growth is driving demand for better voice infrastructure reliability.

Budget approved in principle but timeline depends on Q2 engineering priorities. Competition primarily internal tooling and some consideration of Datadog's new audio monitoring features.
