# Revolut Real-time Fraud Prevention

Alex's security team needs enhanced fraud detection monitoring for Revolut's growing European customer base. Current system has blind spots in cross-border transaction patterns and cryptocurrency fraud detection.

Strong technical alignment - our real-time fraud analytics can process their transaction volume with millisecond response times. Financial services expertise and regulatory compliance capabilities are key differentiators.

UK fintech market is competitive but Revolut's rapid growth creates urgent need for better fraud protection. Budget approved pending security review and compliance validation.
