# Roblox User Safety Analytics - CLOSED LOST

James's safety team had strong interest in our user behavior analytics for child safety monitoring but project was cancelled due to budget constraints. Roblox prioritized other safety initiatives over analytics expansion.

Technical validation was successful with positive feedback on our child safety compliance features. Budget cuts in Q4 2023 eliminated funding for new analytics platforms despite strong business case.

Lost due to budget limitations rather than competitive or technical issues. Relationship remains positive with potential for future opportunities when budget allocation improves.
