# GitLab DevOps Pipeline Insights

Tom's platform team needs advanced analytics for GitLab's CI/CD pipeline performance across their global customer base. Current monitoring lacks visibility into build optimization opportunities and resource utilization patterns.

Strong technical alignment - our DevOps analytics can identify bottlenecks in complex pipeline configurations. GitLab's remote-first culture values data-driven optimization decisions.

Netherlands-based procurement process is efficient. Competition includes internal tooling expansion and potential integration with existing monitoring stack. Our DevOps expertise is a key differentiator.
