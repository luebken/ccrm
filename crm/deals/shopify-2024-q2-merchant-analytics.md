# Shopify Merchant Performance Analytics

Sophie is leading initiative to provide better analytics tools for Shopify's merchant base. They need monitoring capabilities for store performance, conversion rates, and checkout abandonment across their 2M+ merchants.

Good momentum after successful pilot with 100 merchants. Canadian procurement process is straightforward and budget is allocated. Technical integration with Shopify's platform architecture is well-defined.

Main competition is building internal analytics team versus buying external solution. Our e-commerce expertise and rapid deployment capabilities are strong selling points.
