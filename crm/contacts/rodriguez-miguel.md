# Miguel Rodriguez - Stripe

SRE at Stripe, primary contact for our platform implementation. Really solid technical guy.

He's been pushing internally for expanded monitoring coverage, especially around fraud detection systems. Good advocate for us within Stripe.

Planning to meet next week to discuss Q3 expansion scope.
