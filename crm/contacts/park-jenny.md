# Jenny Park - DevOps at Quantum Dynamics

Handles the day-to-day infrastructure at Quantum Dynamics. Works closely with Alex but more hands-on with the monitoring setup.

She's the one who actually found us - was researching solutions for GPU cluster monitoring after they had some expensive training failures.

Very detail-oriented, asks good technical questions during demos.
