# Alex Thompson - Quantum Dynamics CTO

Young CTO, maybe early 30s. Smart guy, very focused on the technical details.

Their main pain point is monitoring GPU training clusters - expensive compute time gets wasted when jobs fail silently. Jenny handles the day-to-day ops but Alex makes the buying decisions.

Funding seems solid but they're careful about spending. Series B was $25M according to TechCrunch.
