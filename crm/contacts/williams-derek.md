# Derek Williams - NexGen Logistics IT

IT director at the logistics company in Houston. More of a traditional IT background, not as technical as some of our other contacts.

Understands the business value of better monitoring for their warehouse systems but the decision process is slow. Mentioned they need to go through committee approval.

Nice guy, responsive to emails. Budget cycle is Q4 so this will be a longer play.
