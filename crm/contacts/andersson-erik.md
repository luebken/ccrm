# Erik Andersson - Klarna Senior Engineer

Works on Klarna's core payment processing systems. Very technical, good English.

He reached out initially after seeing our presentation at a conference in Stockholm. Their current monitoring setup is struggling with the transaction volumes they're processing.

Swedish procurement is methodical but Erik has been helpful navigating their internal processes.
