# Sarah Chen - Airbnb

Infrastructure director, been there about 3 years. Came from Netflix originally.

Very technical, knows monitoring space well. Mentioned they're struggling with booking platform performance during peak seasons - spring break was rough this year.

Seems interested but cautious about vendor changes. DataDog relationship makes this tricky.
