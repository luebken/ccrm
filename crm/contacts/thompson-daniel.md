# Daniel Thompson - Airbnb Senior DevOps Engineer

Senior DevOps engineer at Airbnb working closely with Sarah Chen on infrastructure reliability and deployment automation. Manages containerization, service mesh, and observability tools for the global hospitality platform.

Strong technical background in cloud-native technologies and microservices architecture. Works on the infrastructure team that supports booking platform performance during peak travel seasons. Daniel brings a different perspective from Sarah's director-level view, focusing more on hands-on technical implementation and tooling evaluation.
