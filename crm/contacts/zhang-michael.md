# Michael Zhang - Stripe Fraud Engineering

Engineering manager on Stripe's fraud detection team. Miguel connected us when they started discussing expanded monitoring.

Focused on ML pipeline monitoring for fraud models. Different use case than Miguel's payment processing monitoring but complementary.

Still early in discussions but could be part of the Q3 expansion deal.
