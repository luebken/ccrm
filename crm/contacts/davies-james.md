# James Davies - FinTech Innovations CTO

Co-founder of small fintech startup in London. Young company, about 25 people.

Building cryptocurrency trading platform, needs real-time monitoring for trading algorithms. Interesting technical requirements but budget is limited.

Startup pricing might work but need to qualify budget more carefully.
