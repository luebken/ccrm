# Zendesk Support Experience Optimization

Kevin is negotiating expansion of our existing support analytics into comprehensive customer experience optimization. Stephanie's product team has validated our sentiment analysis and resolution time prediction capabilities.

Contract terms under negotiation including SLA requirements and integration timelines. Existing relationship provides preferred pricing but scope expansion requires executive approval.

Final negotiations focused on implementation timeline and success metrics. Strong renewal potential with additional product integrations planned for future quarters.
