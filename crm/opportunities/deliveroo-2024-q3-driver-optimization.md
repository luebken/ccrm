# Deliveroo Driver Performance Optimization

Emma's engineering team needs advanced analytics to optimize driver allocation and route planning across European markets. Current system struggles with dynamic demand prediction during peak hours and weather events.

Technical validation in progress - our logistics algorithms show promise for improving delivery time accuracy by 15%. UK market leadership gives us good reference potential for European expansion.

Competitive landscape includes internal development and potential partnerships with mapping providers. Our food delivery industry expertise and real-time optimization capabilities are key differentiators.
