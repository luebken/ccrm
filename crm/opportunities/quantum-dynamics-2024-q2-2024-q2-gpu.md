# Quantum Dynamics GPU Monitoring

AI startup needs monitoring for expensive GPU training clusters. Jenny found us after costly training job failures.

Alex makes decisions but Jenny is hands-on technical contact. Good technical fit - they're wasting compute time on failed jobs.

Budget is tight for startup but Series B funding gives them runway. Need to justify ROI on expensive GPU time savings.
