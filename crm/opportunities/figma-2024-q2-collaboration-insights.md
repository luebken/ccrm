# Figma Design Collaboration Analytics

William's product team wants analytics to optimize design collaboration workflows and team productivity. They need insights into design iteration patterns, review cycles, and cross-functional collaboration effectiveness.

Interesting use case combining our collaboration analytics with design-specific metrics. Figma's growth creates need for better team productivity insights as design teams scale globally.

Creative industry expertise required but strong potential for case study value. Budget allocated pending validation of ROI metrics for design team productivity measurement.
