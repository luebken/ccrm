# DataDog Customer Churn Analytics

Interesting opportunity with our competitor DataDog - Carlos needs specialized churn prediction analytics that their platform doesn't currently provide. They want to monitor customer usage patterns and predict churn risk for their enterprise accounts.

Technical requirements are specific to subscription business models and usage-based billing analytics. Our specialized algorithms for SaaS churn prediction are a differentiator here.

Sensitive competitive situation but legitimate business need. Budget approved pending technical validation and ensuring no conflict with their core monitoring business.
