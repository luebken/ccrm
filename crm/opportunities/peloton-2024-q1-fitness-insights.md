# Peloton Fitness Insights Platform - CLOSED LOST

Sarah's product team was interested in fitness performance analytics but timing aligned poorly with Peloton's restructuring and strategic refocus. Sofia's engineering team validated our health analytics capabilities.

Strong technical alignment and positive pilot results but organizational changes and strategic pivot away from new platform investments led to project cancellation. Budget reallocated to core product development.

Lost due to timing and strategic priorities rather than competitive issues. Maintained positive relationship with potential for future engagement when business conditions stabilize.
