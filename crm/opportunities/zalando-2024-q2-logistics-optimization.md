# Zalando European Logistics Optimization

Stefan's logistics team needs advanced monitoring for their European distribution network. Fashion retail requires complex inventory optimization across seasonal demand patterns and regional preferences.

Anna's engineering team has validated our logistics algorithms for their Berlin and Warsaw distribution centers. Strong ROI potential - optimizing inventory allocation could reduce fulfillment costs by 15%.

German procurement process is thorough but straightforward. Competing against SAP logistics suite and internal development. Our fashion retail expertise is a key advantage.
