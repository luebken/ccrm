# Spotify Music Recommendation Analytics

Anna's team wants to expand beyond basic infrastructure monitoring into ML algorithm performance tracking. They need insights into recommendation accuracy and user engagement patterns across their 400M+ users.

Strong technical alignment - our ML monitoring capabilities are exactly what they need. Partnership history gives us preferred vendor status but budget allocation timing is uncertain with Q2 planning cycles.

Main challenge is integrating with their existing Spotify-specific data science tools. Proof of concept scheduled for April.
