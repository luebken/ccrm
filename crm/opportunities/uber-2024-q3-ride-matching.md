# Uber Ride Matching Optimization

Lisa's team is evaluating solutions to monitor and optimize their ride-matching algorithms across global markets. Current system lacks visibility into matching efficiency and wait time prediction accuracy.

Strong business case - reducing average wait times by 10% could significantly impact customer satisfaction and driver utilization. Technical validation in progress with their SF engineering team.

Competing against internal solution and Palantir. Our real-time capabilities and ride-share industry experience are key differentiators. Decision expected after Q2 board review.
