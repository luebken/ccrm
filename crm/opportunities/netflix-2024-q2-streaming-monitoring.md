# Netflix Streaming Quality Monitoring

Major upsell opportunity to expand our existing relationship into comprehensive streaming quality monitoring across their global CDN. Sarah is championing the initiative to reduce buffering complaints during peak hours.

Technical requirements are complex - need real-time monitoring across 190+ countries with sub-second alerting. Rajesh's team has validated our approach technically but procurement process is extensive.

Competition includes internal build-vs-buy decision and DataDog enterprise solution. Our streaming-specific expertise gives us an edge.
