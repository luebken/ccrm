# Klarna Payment Processing Monitoring

Erik reached out after Stockholm conference. Their payment processing volumes are hitting scale limits with current monitoring.

Technical validation went well - they're processing millions of transactions across European markets. Budget seems approved but Swedish procurement process is thorough.

Main competition is building internal solution vs buying external. Need to prove ROI clearly.
