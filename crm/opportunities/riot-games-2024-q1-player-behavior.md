# Riot Games Player Behavior Analytics - CLOSED LOST

David's player experience team evaluated our gaming analytics platform but ultimately decided to build internal solution. Riot Games chose to invest in expanding their existing data science team instead of external platform.

Technical evaluation was positive with successful pilot demonstrating improved player toxicity detection. Decision came down to build-vs-buy analysis where internal development won due to game-specific customization needs.

Lost to internal development decision. Riot preferred maintaining full control over player behavior algorithms and data. Good feedback received for future gaming industry opportunities.
