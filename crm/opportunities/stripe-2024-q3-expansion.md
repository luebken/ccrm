# Stripe Fraud Detection Expansion

Existing customer expansion into fraud detection monitoring. Miguel pushing internally, Michael owns the fraud team requirements.

Current payment monitoring has been successful - good reference for expansion. Security review process will take time but budget is pre-approved.

Proposal submitted last week, waiting for legal and security team feedback.
