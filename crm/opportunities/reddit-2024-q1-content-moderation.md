# Reddit Content Moderation Analytics - CLOSED LOST

Michael's trust and safety team evaluated our content moderation analytics platform but ultimately selected competitor solution. Reddit chose specialized moderation vendor with deeper social media expertise.

Technical evaluation went well but competitor had stronger community management features and existing relationships with major social platforms. Pricing was competitive but feature gaps were decisive.

Lost to ModShield who offered Reddit-specific moderation tools and better integration with their existing community management workflows. Valuable learning for future social media opportunities.
