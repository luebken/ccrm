# FinTech Innovations

Small fintech startup in London, about 25 people. James is co-founder and CTO.

Building some kind of cryptocurrency trading platform. Pretty early but they have decent funding from what James mentioned.

Technical requirements are interesting - they need real-time monitoring of trading algorithms. Small budget though, might not be a good fit for our pricing.
