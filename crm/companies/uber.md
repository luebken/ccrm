# Uber

Global rideshare and logistics platform. Alex runs their infrastructure monitoring for real-time driver/rider matching systems.

Massive scale - millions of rides daily across 70+ countries. Current monitoring gaps around surge pricing algorithms and driver location tracking.

Budget discussions ongoing but they're cautious about vendor changes given their scale requirements.
