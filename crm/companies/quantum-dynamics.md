# Quantum Dynamics

AI startup in Austin working on computer vision for autonomous vehicles. About 80 people, growing fast.

Alex is the CTO, Jenny runs DevOps. They're dealing with training pipeline monitoring issues - lots of GPU clusters, expensive compute time being wasted on failed training runs.

Interesting use case but they're pretty early stage. Funding situation seems solid though, Series B closed in December.
