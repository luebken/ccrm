# NexGen Logistics

Supply chain company in Houston. Derek is their head of IT, seems interested but decision process is slow.

They have warehouse management systems across 15 locations, looking for better visibility into their IoT sensor networks and inventory tracking systems. Not super technical team but they understand the business value.

Budget cycle is Q4, so this is a longer sales cycle. Competition with some smaller regional vendors.
