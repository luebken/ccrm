# Airbnb

Global marketplace for short-term rentals. They're dealing with massive scale issues around host and guest experience monitoring.

Looking at infrastructure observability for their booking platform - they have some serious performance bottlenecks during peak travel seasons. Sarah mentioned they're evaluating multiple vendors but budget approval is tricky with their current market conditions.

Interesting tech stack, lots of microservices. Competition is tight with DataDog already embedded with their platform team.
