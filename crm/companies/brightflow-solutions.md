# BrightFlow Solutions

German industrial automation company in Munich. Hans runs their IT operations.

They manufacture industrial sensors and have IoT monitoring needs across their production facilities. Traditional company but modernizing their tech stack.

Language barrier sometimes but Hans speaks good English. German procurement processes are very thorough - expect long evaluation cycle.
