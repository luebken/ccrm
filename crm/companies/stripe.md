# Stripe

Existing customer since Q4 2023. Payment processing infrastructure monitoring.

Miguel has been great to work with - very technical, understands the value. They're seeing good results from our transaction monitoring dashboards. 

Current expansion discussion around fraud detection monitoring. Budget looks good for Q3, just need to get through their security review process which can take forever.
