# Revolut

UK digital banking platform expanding globally. Thomas manages their payment processing infrastructure.

45M+ customers across 35 countries. Complex regulatory requirements across different jurisdictions. Strong interest in fraud detection monitoring.

Technical validation going well but procurement involves multiple European compliance teams.
