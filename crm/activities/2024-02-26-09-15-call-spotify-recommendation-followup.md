# Spotify Recommendation Analytics Follow-up

Follow-up call with [[contacts/larsson-gustav|Gustav]] from Spotify's data science team after our initial meeting last month. He had some technical questions about how our platform handles the scale and complexity of their recommendation systems.

Gustav's main concerns:
- Spotify processes billions of user interactions daily for their recommendation models
- They need real-time monitoring of model performance across different user segments (free vs premium, geographic regions, music genres)
- Current monitoring doesn't catch when recommendation quality degrades for specific cohorts
- They want to correlate music streaming patterns with recommendation click-through rates

Technical discussion points:
- Our platform can handle their scale (demonstrated similar volume with [[companies/netflix|Netflix]])
- Real-time model drift detection capabilities impressed him
- Showed examples of cohort-based performance monitoring from other ML customers
- Discussed integration with their existing Kafka and Airflow infrastructure

Competitive landscape update: Gustav mentioned they've been talking to several vendors including some custom solutions from consultants. Our advantage is the pre-built ML monitoring capabilities specifically designed for recommendation systems.

Budget and timeline: He confirmed budget approval is likely for Q2, around â‚¬150K. Timeline is flexible but they want to have solution in place before their summer music festival season when recommendation traffic spikes.

Cultural note: Gustav appreciated that we understand the unique challenges of European data privacy requirements (GDPR compliance for user behavior tracking).

Next steps:
- Schedule technical demo with broader ML engineering team
- Provide case study from similar recommendation system customer
- Send technical architecture documentation for their review
