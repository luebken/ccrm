# Uber Demo Preparation - Ride Matching Analytics

Spent afternoon preparing demo environment for [[contacts/patel-rajesh|Rajesh]] and the Uber engineering team. They want to see how our platform can monitor their ride matching algorithms in real-time across different city markets.

Demo setup completed:
- Configured sample data mimicking ride request patterns for SF, NYC, and London markets
- Set up dashboards showing matching latency, driver utilization, and surge pricing triggers
- Created alerting scenarios for when matching algorithms underperform
- Prepared walk-through of anomaly detection for unusual demand patterns

Key demo scenarios to showcase:
1. Real-time monitoring of matching algorithm performance during peak hours
2. Geographic heatmaps showing supply/demand imbalances
3. Alerting when average matching time exceeds thresholds
4. Historical analysis of algorithm changes and their impact on metrics

Rajesh specifically asked to see how we handle high-cardinality data (millions of rides per day) and whether our system can correlate driver behavior patterns with matching success rates.

Technical details prepared:
- Sample dataset with 10M ride requests across 3 cities
- Real-time streaming simulation showing 50K requests/hour
- Drill-down capabilities from city-level to individual driver metrics
- Integration examples with their existing Kafka infrastructure

Demo scheduled for tomorrow at 2 PM. This could be a significant win if we can demonstrate our platform handles their scale and provides actionable insights their current monitoring lacks.
