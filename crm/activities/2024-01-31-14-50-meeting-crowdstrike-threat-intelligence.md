# CrowdStrike Threat Intelligence Partnership Meeting

Excellent strategic meeting with [[contacts/miller-dave|Dave]] from CrowdStrike's business development team and [[contacts/davis-michelle|Michelle]] from their threat intelligence division. This represents a potential game-changing partnership opportunity.

CrowdStrike's strategic initiative:
- Expanding beyond endpoint protection into comprehensive threat analytics
- Want to provide customers with deeper insights from their threat intelligence data
- Current Falcon platform collects massive threat data but analytics capabilities are limited
- Opportunity to differentiate against competitors with superior threat analytics

Partnership model discussion:
Rather than traditional customer relationship, they're proposing integrated partnership:
1. **Technical integration**: Our analytics engine processes CrowdStrike's threat intelligence feeds
2. **Joint go-to-market**: Combined solution sold to enterprise customers
3. **White-label option**: Our analytics offered as CrowdStrike-branded feature
4. **Revenue sharing**: Partnership economics rather than traditional licensing

Michelle outlined specific threat intelligence analytics needs:
- Real-time processing of global threat indicators (IOCs, TTPs, attribution data)
- Predictive analytics for emerging threat campaigns
- Customer-specific threat landscape analysis
- Attribution analysis linking attacks to threat actor groups
- Automated threat hunting insights and recommendations

Technical requirements are significant:
- Processing billions of threat events daily from global sensor network
- Real-time correlation across multiple threat intelligence sources
- Machine learning for threat pattern recognition and prediction
- Integration with existing Falcon platform and APIs
- Multi-tenant architecture for thousands of enterprise customers

Competitive landscape:
- Other security vendors building analytics internally but lacking our expertise
- Traditional analytics platforms don't understand cybersecurity domain
- Our opportunity to become the analytics engine for cybersecurity industry

Dave emphasized this could be $10M+ annual opportunity:
- CrowdStrike has 20,000+ enterprise customers
- Premium analytics feature could increase average customer value significantly
- Global expansion opportunity through CrowdStrike's international presence

Business model benefits for both companies:
- CrowdStrike gets sophisticated analytics without internal development
- We get access to massive cybersecurity market through proven sales channel
- Combined solution addresses larger customer problem than either could solve alone

Next steps agreed:
- Develop joint solution prototype using sample CrowdStrike threat data
- Create partnership agreement framework
- Pilot with select CrowdStrike enterprise customers
- Joint presentation to both companies' executive teams

This could be transformative partnership - not just large revenue opportunity but establishing us as the leading analytics platform for cybersecurity industry.
