# Figma Collaboration Analytics Discussion

Great call with [[contacts/martinez-elena|Elena]] from Figma's product analytics team about building deeper collaboration insights for their design platform. This could be a unique and high-value use case for our analytics platform.

Elena's product vision:
- Design teams want insights into collaboration patterns and productivity
- Current Figma analytics are basic (who accessed what files, when)
- Opportunity to provide sophisticated insights about design workflow optimization
- Could become premium feature for enterprise customers

Specific analytics they want to build:
1. Team collaboration efficiency metrics (how often designers review each other's work)
2. Design iteration patterns (how designs evolve through feedback cycles)
3. Cross-functional collaboration tracking (designers working with PMs, engineers)
4. Productivity insights (time to complete design tasks, review cycles)
5. Design system adoption tracking across teams

Technical requirements:
- Real-time processing of design activity events (file opens, comments, edits)
- User behavior analytics across millions of Figma users
- Privacy-compliant analytics that don't expose sensitive design content  
- Integration with Figma's existing event tracking infrastructure
- Customizable dashboards for different team sizes and structures

Elena was particularly interested in our ability to handle high-cardinality user behavior data and create meaningful insights from complex interaction patterns. She mentioned Figma processes billions of design events daily.

Competitive considerations: They've looked at general analytics platforms but need design-specific insights that generic tools can't provide. Our advantage is flexibility to create custom metrics for their unique use case.

Budget and timeline: Elena mentioned $180K budget for this initiative in 2024. Timeline is Q2-Q3 for initial implementation, with broader rollout planned for 2025.

Business impact: If successful, this could help Figma differentiate against competitors like Adobe XD and Sketch by providing unique collaboration insights.

Next steps:
- Create mockups showing example collaboration analytics dashboards
- Schedule demo with broader product team
- Provide technical proposal for processing Figma's event volume
