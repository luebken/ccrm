# MongoDB Performance Monitoring Strategy

Strategic session with [[contacts/patel-krish|Krish]] and [[contacts/williams-sarah|Sarah]] from MongoDB's product management team. They're evaluating how to enhance performance monitoring capabilities for their enterprise customers.

Current state analysis:
- MongoDB provides basic performance metrics in Atlas but customers want deeper insights
- Enterprise customers often supplement with third-party monitoring (Datadog, New Relic)
- Opportunity to provide more sophisticated database-specific analytics
- Could differentiate MongoDB Atlas from other managed database offerings

Customer pain points they identified:
1. Slow query identification across complex applications
2. Resource utilization optimization for cost reduction
3. Predictive scaling based on usage patterns
4. Cross-collection performance analysis
5. Real-time alerting for performance degradation

Sarah mentioned specific customer feedback from large enterprises who are paying for multiple monitoring tools because MongoDB's native monitoring lacks depth. Krish sees this as a competitive disadvantage against other database platforms with better monitoring.

Technical architecture discussion:
- Need to process performance metrics from thousands of MongoDB clusters
- Real-time analysis of query patterns and resource usage
- Integration with existing MongoDB tooling and APIs
- White-label capability for MongoDB to offer as native feature

Competitive landscape: They're aware that [[companies/datadog|Datadog]] and others provide MongoDB monitoring but it's not purpose-built for their specific use cases. Our opportunity is creating database-specific insights that generic monitoring platforms don't provide.

Business model implications:
- Could be offered as premium Atlas feature
- Might help reduce customer churn to other database platforms
- Potential to increase MongoDB's average customer value

Budget discussion: Krish confirmed significant budget availability for strategic product initiatives. This would be treated as product investment rather than typical vendor purchase.

Partnership potential: Rather than traditional customer relationship, they're interested in deeper partnership where we provide white-labeled monitoring capabilities integrated into Atlas.

Next steps:
- Provide analysis of competitor database monitoring offerings
- Create demo showing MongoDB-specific performance insights
- Explore partnership model vs traditional licensing
