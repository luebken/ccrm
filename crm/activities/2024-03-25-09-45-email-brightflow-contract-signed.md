# BrightFlow Contract Signed - Deal Closed!

Great email from [[contacts/mueller-hans|Hans]] confirming the signed contract came through this morning. [[opportunities/brightflow-2024-q1-iot|BrightFlow deal]] is officially closed won at â‚¬65K.

Hans mentioned their legal team was satisfied with the data processing agreements for GDPR compliance, which was their main concern. Implementation timeline is set for Q2 - they want to start with their Munich facility first before rolling out to other locations.

This gives us a good reference customer for European industrial IoT monitoring. Hans said he'd be willing to speak with other German manufacturing companies about the implementation.

Next steps:
- Handoff to implementation team
- Schedule kickoff meeting for April 15
- Add Hans to reference customer list for German prospects
- Update deal stage to closed-won in our tracking
