# N26 Customer Onboarding Analytics Call

Strategic call with [[contacts/schmidt-anna|Anna]] from N26's growth team about optimizing their customer onboarding experience through better analytics. This fits perfectly with our fintech expertise.

N26's onboarding challenges:
- High drop-off rates during account opening process (30-40% abandon)
- Regulatory requirements make onboarding complex (KYC, identity verification)
- Different onboarding flows for different European markets
- Limited visibility into where customers get stuck in the process

Anna explained current pain points:
1. Can't identify specific onboarding steps causing highest drop-off
2. No real-time alerts when onboarding completion rates decline
3. A/B testing results take too long to analyze and act on
4. Country-specific onboarding performance varies significantly

Key analytics requirements:
- Real-time onboarding funnel analysis with step-by-step completion rates
- Geographic performance comparison across EU markets
- Cohort analysis of onboarding success by customer segments
- Predictive modeling to identify customers likely to abandon
- Integration with existing customer data platforms

Technical considerations:
- Need to handle sensitive financial data with strict privacy controls
- GDPR compliance for customer behavior analytics
- Real-time processing of onboarding events across mobile and web platforms
- Integration with N26's existing analytics and marketing tools

Anna was particularly interested in our fintech experience and understanding of European privacy requirements. She mentioned they've looked at general conversion optimization tools but need something that understands banking onboarding complexities.

Competitive landscape: They're currently using basic analytics but nothing sophisticated enough for real-time optimization. Mentioned conversations with other analytics providers but none with strong fintech focus.

Business impact potential: Anna estimates 10% improvement in onboarding completion could add â‚¬5M+ annual revenue, making our analytics investment highly ROI-positive.

Timeline and budget: She confirmed budget availability for customer experience improvements in 2024. Timeline is flexible but they want to show onboarding improvements by summer.

Next steps:
- Send case studies from other fintech onboarding analytics projects
- Provide demo focused on fintech-specific onboarding metrics
- Schedule technical discussion with their engineering team
