# Shopify Merchant Analytics Platform Meeting

Productive session with [[contacts/martinez-sofia|Sofia]] from product management and [[contacts/patel-arjun|Arjun]] from the data team. They're looking to enhance merchant-facing analytics in their admin dashboard.

Current state: Merchants can see basic sales metrics but want deeper insights into customer behavior patterns, inventory optimization, and predictive analytics for seasonal trends. Sofia mentioned merchant retention improves significantly when they have better data insights.

Technical deep-dive with Arjun revealed they're processing 50M+ events per day across all merchants. Their current analytics stack is hitting performance limits and they need real-time dashboards that can handle merchant-specific queries without impacting core commerce functionality.

Key requirements validated:
- Real-time revenue and conversion tracking per merchant
- Predictive analytics for inventory management 
- Customer segmentation and cohort analysis
- White-label dashboard customization options

Competitive landscape: They've looked at building internally but resource constraints make vendor solution more attractive. Mentioned conversations with Mixpanel and Amplitude but those don't handle the e-commerce specific use cases well.

Arjun was impressed with our multi-tenancy architecture and real-time query performance. Sofia liked the customizable dashboard framework we showed.

Budget discussion: Sofia confirmed $200K+ is approved for 2024, decision timeline is 6-8 weeks. Need security review and legal approval for data processing.

Next steps:
- Provide 2-week POC proposal with sample merchant data
- Schedule demo with broader product team
- Send security questionnaire responses by January 22
