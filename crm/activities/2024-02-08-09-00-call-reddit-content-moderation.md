# Reddit Content Moderation Analytics Call

Insightful call with [[contacts/johnson-emma|Emma]] from Reddit's trust and safety team about their content moderation analytics needs. This is a fascinating use case that combines social media scale with sophisticated safety requirements.

Reddit's moderation challenges:
- Processing 50M+ posts and comments daily across 100K+ communities
- Each community (subreddit) has unique moderation rules and standards
- Current analytics don't provide actionable insights for moderator effectiveness
- Regulatory pressure increasing for content safety across different countries

Emma explained their current pain points:
1. Moderators (both paid and volunteer) lack visibility into their performance trends
2. No predictive analytics for identifying problematic content before it spreads
3. Community-specific insights needed since r/politics has different needs than r/gaming
4. Cross-community trend analysis for coordinated harmful content

Technical requirements discussed:
- Real-time processing of massive content streams
- Natural language processing for content sentiment and safety scoring
- Community-specific analytics dashboards for 100K+ subreddits  
- Integration with existing moderation tools and workflow systems
- Privacy-compliant analytics that respect user anonymization

Emma was particularly interested in our ability to handle high-cardinality analytics (millions of users, hundreds of thousands of communities) and provide real-time insights that could help moderators be more effective.

Competitive landscape: They've looked at general social media analytics platforms but those don't understand the unique Reddit community structure. Our advantage is flexibility to create community-specific monitoring.

Regulatory considerations: Emma mentioned increasing legal requirements around content moderation effectiveness, especially in EU markets. Better analytics could help demonstrate compliance with regulatory expectations.

Budget and timeline: She confirmed budget availability for trust and safety initiatives is strong in 2024. Timeline is flexible but they want to show moderation improvements before next major regulatory review.

Cultural fit: Emma appreciated that we understand the balance between community autonomy and platform-wide safety requirements that makes Reddit unique.

Next steps:
- Schedule demo with broader trust and safety team
- Provide examples of community-specific analytics dashboards
- Research regulatory requirements for content moderation reporting
