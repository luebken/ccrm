# Stripe Expansion Planning Meeting

Good meeting with [[contacts/rodriguez-miguel|Miguel]] and [[contacts/zhang-michael|Michael]] to nail down requirements for [[opportunities/stripe-2024-q3-expansion|fraud detection expansion]].

Michael explained their ML pipeline monitoring needs - they're running dozens of fraud models in real-time and need better visibility when models drift or perform poorly. Different from Miguel's payment processing monitoring but fits well with our platform.

Key requirements:
- Model performance tracking across 15+ fraud detection algorithms
- Real-time alerting when fraud catch rates drop
- Integration with their existing MLOps pipeline

Budget is pre-approved at $125K, just need to get through security review which Miguel says usually takes 4-6 weeks.

Action items:
- Send formal proposal by March 20
- Include security questionnaire responses  
- Schedule demo for broader fraud team next month
