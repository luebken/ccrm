# Quantum Dynamics Technical Demo

Demo went really well. [[contacts/thompson-alex|Alex]] and [[contacts/park-jenny|Jenny]] were both on the call - Alex asked business questions while Jenny dug into technical details.

Their pain point is clear - they're running 24/7 GPU training jobs that cost $500-2000 per run. When jobs fail silently or models don't converge properly, they waste expensive compute time. Had one incident last month where a failed job ran for 3 days before anyone noticed - $15K down the drain.

Jenny was impressed with our GPU utilization dashboards and the ability to set alerts on training job health metrics. Alex liked the cost tracking features.

They're evaluating us vs building something internal. Alex mentioned their Series B gives them runway but they're still careful about spending. Need to show clear ROI on GPU cost savings.

Next steps:
- Send ROI analysis showing potential savings
- Connect them with reference customer doing similar ML monitoring
- Proposal due end of March if technical validation continues going well
