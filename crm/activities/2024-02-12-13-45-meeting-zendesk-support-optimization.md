# Zendesk Support Analytics Deep Dive

Excellent meeting with [[contacts/chen-sarah|Sarah]] and [[contacts/murphy-lisa|Lisa]] from Zendesk's product analytics team. They're exploring how to provide better insights to their customers about support team performance and customer satisfaction trends.

Current state: Zendesk customers can see basic ticket metrics but want deeper insights into agent performance, customer sentiment analysis, and predictive analytics for support volume forecasting. Sarah mentioned this could be a significant differentiator against competitors like Freshworks and Intercom.

Detailed use cases discussed:
1. Real-time agent performance dashboards with quality scores
2. Sentiment analysis of customer interactions to predict escalations
3. Automated insights into common issue patterns and resolution strategies  
4. Predictive analytics for staffing based on historical ticket volume patterns
5. Custom reporting for different customer segments (SMB vs Enterprise)

Lisa raised competitive concerns about [[companies/datadog|Datadog]] since they already provide monitoring for many Zendesk customers. Our positioning: we focus specifically on customer support analytics while Datadog is general infrastructure monitoring.

Technical architecture discussion revealed they need:
- Multi-tenant analytics platform serving 100K+ Zendesk customers
- Real-time processing of millions of support tickets daily
- White-label dashboard options with customer branding
- Flexible API for integration with existing Zendesk Suite

Budget and timeline: Sarah confirmed $300K budget is allocated for this initiative. Decision timeline is 8-10 weeks with implementation planned for Q3. They want to launch this as a premium add-on to their existing Suite offering.

Competitive dynamics: They've had early conversations with Tableau and Looker but those require significant custom development. Our advantage is purpose-built support analytics with pre-built dashboards and insights.

Next steps:
- 2-week POC using sample Zendesk support data
- Demonstrate white-label customization capabilities
- Security review for multi-tenant architecture
