# Robinhood Market Data Monitoring Architecture Review

Intensive technical session with [[contacts/kim-jenny|Jenny]] from infrastructure and [[contacts/thompson-kevin|Kevin]] from the trading systems team. They needed deep dive into our architecture for monitoring high-frequency market data feeds.

Current challenges at Robinhood:
- Processing 100M+ market data messages per second during peak trading hours
- Need sub-millisecond detection of data feed latency or gaps
- Current monitoring adds too much overhead to their core trading systems
- Regulatory requirements for audit trails of all market data processing

Technical deep-dive covered:
1. Our zero-copy architecture for high-frequency data processing
2. Custom wire protocol optimizations for market data formats
3. Hardware acceleration using FPGA cards for pattern detection
4. Time-synchronized monitoring across multiple data centers

Kevin's main concern was latency impact on their trading algorithms. Showed benchmarks from our [[companies/coinbase|Coinbase]] deployment where we added <0.1ms overhead to their critical path. Jenny was impressed with our ability to handle their message volume without affecting core trading performance.

Architecture validation points:
- Demonstrated handling similar scale at other fintech customers
- Showed regulatory compliance features for audit logging
- Reviewed disaster recovery and failover capabilities
- Discussed integration with their existing Kafka and Redis infrastructure

Competitive dynamics: They mentioned previous conversations with specialized market data vendors, but those solutions were either too expensive or required replacing existing infrastructure. Our advantage is monitoring overlay that doesn't require infrastructure changes.

Budget discussion: Kevin confirmed $250K budget is approved for market data monitoring improvements. Timeline is tight - they want solution in place before next earnings season (April) when trading volume typically spikes.

Concerns to address:
- Need proof of sub-millisecond latency impact on production systems
- Want references from other high-frequency trading customers
- Regulatory compliance documentation for FINRA requirements

Next steps:
- Provide detailed latency benchmarks from production deployments
- Connect them with reference customer for peer validation
- Send regulatory compliance documentation package
