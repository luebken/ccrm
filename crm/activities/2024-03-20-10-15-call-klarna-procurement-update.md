# Klarna Procurement Update Call

Quick call with [[contacts/andersson-erik|Erik]] to understand where we stand in Klarna's vendor evaluation process.

Good news - technical validation is complete and they're satisfied with our payment processing monitoring capabilities. Erik confirmed budget approval came through last week.

Now it's all about the procurement process. Swedish companies are very thorough - they need additional security documentation and want references from other European fintech companies. Erik mentioned timeline is probably 6-8 more weeks.

He suggested connecting with [[companies/adyen|Adyen]] as a reference since [[contacts/van-der-berg-lisa|Lisa]] might be willing to speak with Klarna's team about our partnership.

Also mentioned their main concern is vendor lock-in - they want to ensure we can integrate with their existing monitoring tools rather than replace everything.

Follow-up:
- Send additional security docs by Friday
- Ask Lisa if she'd be willing to be a reference
- Schedule follow-up in 2 weeks to check progress
