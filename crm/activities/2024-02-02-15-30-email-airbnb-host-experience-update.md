# Airbnb Host Experience Analytics Update

Received great update from [[contacts/zhang-michael|Michael]] about the host experience analytics project. Timeline has been accelerated due to increased priority from Airbnb leadership.

Key updates from Michael's email:
- Host satisfaction is now a top-3 company priority for 2024
- Recent analysis showed correlation between host experience and overall marketplace health
- Budget has been increased from $150K to $250K for expanded scope
- Timeline moved up - they want solution live by May instead of Q3

Expanded project scope now includes:
1. Original host performance analytics and satisfaction tracking
2. New: Predictive modeling for host churn risk
3. New: Automated insights for host onboarding optimization
4. New: Geographic analysis of host experience by market

Michael mentioned competitive pressure from [[companies/airbnb|Airbnb]]'s competitors and other vacation rental platforms is driving urgency. Airbnb wants to strengthen host loyalty through better data insights and support.

Technical implications of scope expansion:
- Need to handle data from 4M+ active hosts globally
- Real-time processing of host interactions and guest feedback
- Integration with multiple Airbnb internal systems
- Machine learning models for churn prediction

This scope increase plays to our strengths in predictive analytics and real-time processing. The expanded budget also makes this one of our larger deals for Q1.

Implementation timeline:
- POC phase: February 15 - March 1
- Technical validation: March 1 - March 15  
- Full implementation: March 15 - May 1
- Go-live: May 1

Risks to manage:
- Aggressive timeline requires dedicated engineering resources
- Integration complexity with Airbnb's microservices architecture
- Need to deliver measurable host satisfaction improvements quickly

Next steps:
- Schedule POC kickoff meeting for February 15
- Allocate additional engineering resources for accelerated timeline
- Update contract to reflect expanded scope and budget
