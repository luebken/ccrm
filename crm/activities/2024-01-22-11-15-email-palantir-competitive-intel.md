# Palantir Competitive Intelligence - Government RFP

Received valuable intel from [[contacts/thompson-daniel|Daniel]] about the government analytics RFP we're both competing for. He was surprisingly open about Palantir's approach, probably trying to gauge our positioning.

Key insights from his email:
- Palantir is positioning heavily on their existing government relationships and security clearances
- Their technical approach focuses on graph analytics and relationship mapping
- Price point is significantly higher than ours ($2M+ vs our $800K proposal)
- They're weak on real-time monitoring capabilities which is a key requirement

Daniel mentioned they're concerned about our real-time alerting and streaming analytics capabilities since government agencies increasingly need faster threat detection. He also asked pointed questions about our compliance certifications which suggests that's their main attack vector.

Our advantages based on this conversation:
- Superior real-time processing and alerting
- More cost-effective solution
- Better integration with modern cloud infrastructure
- Faster deployment timeline (3 months vs their 12+ months)

Areas we need to strengthen:
- Government reference customers (we have fewer than they do)
- Security clearance requirements for key personnel
- Compliance certification timeline

Strategic response:
- Emphasize speed and cost advantages in our proposal
- Get security clearance process started for team members
- Reach out to existing government contacts for references
- Position this as modern vs legacy technology decision

Updated our proposal to highlight these differentiation points and sent revised version to procurement team.
