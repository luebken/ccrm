# Erik Johansson - PayFlow DevOps Lead

DevOps lead at Swedish payment company. Technical guy, good English but prefers calls over emails.

Their payment processing infrastructure is hitting scale issues. Erik mentioned they process about 50K transactions per day across Nordic countries.

Interested in our monitoring platform but cautious about vendor selection. Swedish companies like thorough evaluations.
