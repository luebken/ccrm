# TechFlow Solutions

Dutch fintech startup in Amsterdam, about 80 people. Building payment infrastructure for European e-commerce.

Pieter reached out after seeing our conference presentation. They're struggling with monitoring their payment processing systems during high-traffic events.

European compliance requirements are important to them - GDPR, PCI DSS, etc. Budget discussion still early but they seem to have decent funding.
