# PayFlow Nordic Payment Monitoring

Swedish fintech needs monitoring for payment processing across Nordic markets. Erik is evaluating vendors.

Their current homegrown solution can't handle the transaction volumes - about 50K daily transactions with plans to 5x that by year-end.

Technical validation looks good but Swedish procurement process is slow. Competition with DataDog and some internal build vs buy discussion.
