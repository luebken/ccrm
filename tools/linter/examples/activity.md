# PayFlow Requirements Follow-up Call

Quick call with [[contacts/johansson-erik|Erik]] to clarify technical requirements for [[deals/payflow-2024-q2-nordic|Nordic payment monitoring]].

Erik explained their architecture better - they have payment processing across Sweden, Norway, and Denmark with different compliance requirements per country. About 50K transactions daily now but expecting rapid growth.

Main pain points:
- Current monitoring can't handle transaction volume spikes
- No visibility into payment processing latency by region
- Manual alerting when payment systems go down

Budget range seems to be â‚¬80-100K for annual contract. Erik mentioned they're also evaluating DataDog but likes our payment-specific monitoring features.

Next steps: Send pricing proposal by March 20, schedule demo with broader team in April.
